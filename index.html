<h>Sports drinks can help during long or intense exercise because they replace the electrolytes you lose when you sweat, provide quick energy through carbohydrates, and help your body stay hydrated. They’re most useful for workouts lasting over an hour, in hot weather, or during high-intensity sports. For short or light exercise, though, water is usually enough.</h>
